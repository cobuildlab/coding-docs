## **1.2 Prefer the use of `constants` over `variables`.**

Prefer the use of `constants` over `variables` for holding values always that is possible.

- The use of constants reduces the occurrences of bugs by reducing the origins of errors like: assignments, loops, contexts, etc.
- Code readability, constants values by definition cannot change, making the code easier to read and to debug.
- Efficiency: Many Runtimes promise faster access to constant values than to variables values.

This set of practices are heavily based on these books:

This document aims to reduce the friction between patterns, conventions and best practices to right `effective code`. (See below)

### **Effective code:**

- Easy to understand
- Well organized
- Self descriptive
- Well documented
- Easily Testable
- Easily Debuggable
- Named under a clear pattern
- Robust: enhancements don't create undesired side effects
- Portable: easy to reuse
- Predictable
- [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) compliant

### as the contrast of **Ineffective Code:**

- Difficult to understand and read
- Difficult to test
- Difficult to debug: Given a fail scenario is not clear to the eye where the error is being generated
- Does more than 1 thing
